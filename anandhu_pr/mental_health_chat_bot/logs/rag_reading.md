Maintaining meaningful social connections through spending time with loved ones and volunteering can significantly boost mental well-being.  Regular meditation (15 minutes daily) combined with yoga poses can also improve mental health, though it takes consistent practice (two months) to establish it as a habit.  Proactive self-care, including relaxation techniques, can prevent or alleviate mental health issues.

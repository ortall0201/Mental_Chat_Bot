Since you're feeling neutral, let's proactively nurture your well-being.  Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Connect with someone you care about:**  Even a brief phone call or text to a friend or family member can boost your mood and strengthen your social connections.  Small acts of connection can make a big difference.

2. **Incorporate a mindful moment:** Try a simple 5-minute breathing exercise. Find a quiet space, sit comfortably, and focus on your breath entering and leaving your body. This can help center you and promote a sense of calm.

3. **Engage in a relaxing activity:**  What do you enjoy doing that helps you unwind?  This could be reading a book, listening to music, taking a walk in nature, or pursuing a hobby.  Schedule some time for this activity today to help maintain a positive emotional state.

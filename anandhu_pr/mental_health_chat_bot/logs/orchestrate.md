You seem to be feeling neutral, which is perfectly fine!  To maintain this positive state and perhaps even boost your mood slightly, I suggest trying a quick stretch or some deep breathing exercises.  Maintaining a balanced lifestyle is key to overall well-being, so remember to prioritize regular sleep, light exercise, and incorporating mindfulness practices into your day.  Even small acts of self-care, like connecting with a friend or engaging in a creative activity, can make a difference.
